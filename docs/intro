ruvi is a vim clone.
you can use most of the normal keybindings.
including v, V and ctrl-v.
the file ~/.ruvirc is executed on startup, it is ruby code.
application settings can be accessed via app.settings.
example: app.settings[:ts] = "4" # sets the tab size
adding multi-key (e.g "\C-xa" -> ctrl-x, followed by an a) bindings:
   app.add_binding(keyseq) { my_code }
adding commands (e.g :mycmd myparam) for example:
   app.setup_cmd("command", /regexp/) { |cmdline, the_regexp| cmdline =~ the_regexp; print $1 }
